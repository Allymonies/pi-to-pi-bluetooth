Bluetooth Utilities For Pi2Pi Communication

Most of this works off of using https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=162689 as initial setup to get communication going. Make sure you've paired your devices and all that fun stuff.

Uses:

* Devices are time-synced based off the master pi which should probably have an RTC installed.

* Messages are relayed for use in other programs.
